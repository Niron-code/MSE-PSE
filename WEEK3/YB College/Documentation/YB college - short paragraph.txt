The YB College database is designed to manage and organize essential information about students, lecturers, courses, and enrollments.
The database will record student details, lecturer profiles, and course information, as well as which students are enrolled in which courses.

Entities will be used: STUDENT, LECTURER, COURSE, ENROLLMENT, LECTURER_COURSE

STUDENT: Each student has a unique ID, name, profile, and contact info.
LECTURER: Each lecturer has a unique ID, name, profile, and contact info.
COURSE: Each course has a unique ID, a name, and is taught by many lecturers (lecturer_id is a foreign key).
ENROLLMENT: This table links students to courses, recording each enrollment with its own ID, and foreign keys for student and course.
LECTURER_COURSE: This table represents the many-to-many relationship between lecturers and courses. Each record contains a unique ID, a lecturer_id (FK), and a course_id (FK).
